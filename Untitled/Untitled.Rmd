  **Background:** Extreme Risk Protection Orders (ERPOs), also known as "red flag laws," allow law enforcement or family members to petition a court to temporarily remove firearms from individuals deemed to pose a risk to themselves or others. Although ERPO laws are designed to prevent firearm-related harm, evidence on their population-level impact on suicide rates remains limited.

  **Methods:** We conducted a state-year panel analysis using a Bayesian autoregressive model to evaluate the effect of ERPO enactment on firearm suicide rates among adults in the United States from 2000 to 2022. Our primary outcome was the state-level annual firearm suicide rate, stratified by sex and age group.

  **Results:** ERPO implementation was associated with a posterior mean reduction in firearm suicide rates of X per 100,000 population (95% credible interval: Y–Z) among adult men, with no significant change among women. Sensitivity analyses adjusting for time-varying state-level covariates and model specifications yielded consistent findings.

  **Conclusions:** ERPO laws may be effective in reducing firearm suicide rates, particularly among men. These findings support the continued expansion and enforcement of ERPO legislation as part of a comprehensive suicide prevention strategy.

# Introduction

Firearm suicide is a major public health crisis in the United States, accounting for more than half of all suicide deaths each year. Men constitute the vast majority of firearm suicide decedents, and the lethality of firearms makes attempts with guns far more likely to result in death than other methods.

Extreme Risk Protection Orders (ERPOs) have emerged as a promising legal mechanism to temporarily restrict firearm access for individuals deemed at imminent risk of harm to themselves or others. These civil orders, enacted in more than 20 states, are designed to interrupt escalating risk—particularly for individuals experiencing suicidal crises. While case reports and early evaluations have suggested that ERPOs may be effective in averting imminent suicide attempts, population-level evidence on their longer-term effects remains limited and contested.

In this study, we use a Bayesian state-year panel model to evaluate the effect of ERPO laws on firearm suicide rates. Our analysis spans over two decades and includes all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. We hypothesize that the implementation of ERPO laws is associated with a measurable reduction in firearm suicide, particularly among men.

\item \footnotesize{\textit{Notes:} This figure shows the annual spread of ERPO laws across U.S. states from 1999 to 2024. States are color-coded by implementation status: orange indicates states that newly implemented an ERPO law in that year, blue indicates states with previously implemented ERPO laws, and gray indicates states without such laws. ERPO laws allow for the temporary removal of firearms from individuals deemed to be at risk of harming themselves or others. By 2024, 22 states had enacted ERPO legislation.}

# Methods

The study was determined to be exempt from review and from a requirement for informed consent, because it used no identifiable human participant data, by the RAND institutional review board. The study follows good research practices for comparative effectiveness research,15 eg, the data sources, modeling methods, primary comparisons, and sensitivity tests were preregistered, and the data and statistical code are available. The eAppendix in Supplement 1 provides a detailed discussion of how the current study extends and improves prior published research by the authors.

## Data

Mortality data from 1999 to 2023 come from the National Vital Statistics System, which provides information on coroners' cause of death determinations for a near-census of deaths in the United States [@cdc2021wonder, @cdc2024wonder]. Our primary analysis is restricted to the query to suicide deaths involving firearms among adults aged 18 years and older, grouping results by state and year. Population denominators were drawn from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Vintage postcensal population estimates, which provide single-race, state-level resident population counts as of July 1 of each year. Information on the effective dates of firearm laws come from the RAND State Firearm Law Database. The analyses also include state-level demographic, economic, crime, and gun ownership characteristics; sources for these are described in the eAppendix in Supplement 1.


Mortality data from 2018 to 2023 were obtained from the Underlying Cause of Death, 2018–2023, Single Race dataset in the CDC WONDER Online Database, maintained by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) [@cdc2024wonder]. We restricted the query to suicide deaths involving firearms among adults aged 18 years and older, using single-year age categories and grouping results by state and year. The outcome variable was the firearm suicide rate per 100,000 population, calculated using default intercensal and postcensal population estimates provided by the U.S. Census Bureau through the CDC platform.
