# Introduction

Firearm suicide is a major public health crisis in the United States, accounting for more than half of all suicide deaths each year. Men constitute the vast majority of firearm suicide decedents, and the lethality of firearms makes attempts with guns far more likely to result in death than other methods.

Extreme Risk Protection Orders (ERPOs) have emerged as a promising legal mechanism to temporarily restrict firearm access for individuals deemed at imminent risk of harm to themselves or others. These civil orders, enacted in more than 20 states, are designed to interrupt escalating risk—particularly for individuals experiencing suicidal crises. While case reports and early evaluations have suggested that ERPOs may be effective in averting imminent suicide attempts, population-level evidence on their longer-term effects remains limited and contested.

In this study, we use a Bayesian state-year panel model to evaluate the effect of ERPO laws on firearm suicide rates. Our analysis spans over two decades and includes all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. We hypothesize that the implementation of ERPO laws is associated with a measurable reduction in firearm suicide, particularly among men.

    \footnotesize\textit{This figure shows the annual spread of ERPO laws across U.S. states from 1999 to 2024. States are color-coded by implementation status: orange indicates states that newly implemented an ERPO law in that year, blue indicates states with previously implemented ERPO laws, and gray indicates states without such laws. ERPO laws allow for the temporary removal of firearms from individuals deemed to be at risk of harming themselves or others. By 2024, 22 states had enacted ERPO legislation.

# Methods

The study was determined to be exempt from review and from a requirement for informed consent, because it used no identifiable human participant data, by the RAND institutional review board. The study follows good research practices for comparative effectiveness research,15 eg, the data sources, modeling methods, primary comparisons, and sensitivity tests were preregistered, and the data and statistical code are available. The eAppendix in Supplement 1 provides a detailed discussion of how the current study extends and improves prior published research by the authors.

## Data

Mortality data from 1999 to 2023 come from the National Vital Statistics System, which provides information on coroners' cause of death determinations for a near-census of deaths in the United States [@cdc2021wonder], [@cdc2024wonder]. Information on the effective dates of firearm laws come from the RAND State Firearm Law Database.18 The analyses also include state-level demographic, economic, crime, and gun ownership characteristics; sources for these are described in the eAppendix in Supplement 1.
